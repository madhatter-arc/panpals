One behavioral science graduate, a mechanical engineer, and an architect walk into a room and pretend they’re product managers, software engineers, and UI/UX designers. For what? To make you cook more. Why? Sorry, we lied. It’s actually an app we made for ourselves and our friends.

Then people sent it to other people, and suddenly it felt like ONE BIG TABLE. Because we wanted to celebrate home cooking and bond over it. Even if it’s a sad sandwich. Or mediocre pasta. Or a very delicate charcuterie board. Someone even made a whole feast for hosting. Impressed all of us. Whatever.

We’re all just trying to cook one more time a week. Not every day. Just sometimes. To eat healthier. To save money. To have control over our ingredients. It’s not just about sharing recipes, there are already too many of those. Exhausting. We don’t need education. We need motivation.

And no calorie tracking, please. That’s sooo Tumblr 2014. We don’t need restrictions. We need encouragement. To hold ourselves accountable, track weekly cooking goals, and feel like we’re making progress. Why not? Like Strava, Letterboxd, Goodreads, or Duolingo, but for HOME COOKING.

Celebratory. Fun. With your PALS. Do you have a secret Instagram or a cluttered photo gallery of your meals? Do you send pictures of your home-cooked dishes to your mom, cousins, or friends? See? You need PanPals too.

Come join us at our ONE BIG TABLE. It’s only on iOS for now because there are just three of us, and this is our first time BUILDING AN APP. And we don’t have funding yet.
Come join us. Celebrate home cooking. Bond over real food.
